Actually helping. Showing up with real solutions, putting the other person first, and genuinely helping them.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s what sell-by-chat is all about.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the simplest, most scalable way to start meaningful conversations, build trust, and close deals.\u00a0\n\nNo ads. No fancy funnels. Just you, your LinkedIn account, and the magic of being genuinely helpful.\n\nIs it easy? Hell no. It takes work. But it\u2019s the kind of work that pays off, because it\u2019s built on serving, not selling. And when you get this right, selling stops feeling awkward and starts feeling...natural.\n\nThis isn\u2019t another \u201chack.\u201d It\u2019s the smart way to turn effort into results. All you need is a willingness to act, a bit of dedication, and this playbook in your hands.\n\nReady?\n\nLet\u2019s turn your DMs into cash on LinkedIn."

What works now is having real conversations that build trust and naturally turn into deals.\n\nLinkedIn is the perfect platform for this. It's where professionals go to network, learn, and grow. That means your ideal clients are already there, waiting for the right conversation.\u00a0\n\nNot a pitch, but a chat.\n\nThat's what this playbook is about\u2014mastering sell-by-chat.

Because if you just start talking to the people you want to work with, they\u2019ll tell you their problems. And if you listen, they\u2019ll hand you the blueprint for what to sell them.\n\nSo, technically, there are no prerequisites other than a LinkedIn account to use this playbook. You can dive in and build your business as you go.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real\u2014most people aren\u2019t comfortable with this approach. It feels unnatural, maybe even downright weird. We get it.\n\nIf you want to feel more confident and come across as a total pro from day one, we recommend completing The 101 Module from the www.sevenfigurecreators.com program.\n\nThe 101 Module will guide you to:\n\nFind, create or improve your offer.\nOptimise your LinkedIn profile & content for trust.\nSet you up with everything you need to sell more and faster.\n\nNot a member?

Start serving.\n\nChat-based selling works not because you're trying to shove your offer down someone's throat but because you're solving their problems\u2014problems they've already told you about.\u00a0\n\nPeople hate being sold to, but they love being helped. When you focus on serving, selling happens naturally.\n\nThink about it like this: every chat is an opportunity to make someone's day better. Maybe you'll share a tip that changes how they approach their business. Maybe you'll point them to a resource that saves them hours of frustration. And maybe, just maybe, you'll uncover a problem you can help solve for them directly.\n\nThe sale? That's the side effect of being genuinely helpful."

    "MAIN":"Overcoming Common Excuses and Misconceptions #\n\nLet's tackle the biggest excuses you've probably told yourself about sell-by-chat.\n\n1. \"It feels too salesy\"\n\nSure, if you're spamming canned pitches to random strangers, it's salesy\u2014and gross. But if you're showing up like a real human, listening, and responding to what people actually need, it won't feel salesy at all. It'll feel like a conversation between two people who respect each other.\n\n2. \"It takes too long\"\n\nHere's the truth: chatting is a time investment, but it's also the fastest path to results. Done right, it beats cold calls, email sequences, or lots of zoom calls. And if you follow this playbook, you'll know exactly what to say, when to say it, and how to move people forward without wasting time.\n\n3. \"Leads go cold\"\n\nMost leads don't go cold. They're just waiting for you to follow up. The magic is in the follow-ups\u2014those fifth, sixth, or even seventh touches. Don't write someone off because they didn't respond right away. Be persistent but respectful, and you'll resurrect plenty of \"dead\" leads.\n\n4. \"Outsourcing doesn't work\"\n\nYou can hand off chat sales to someone else\u2014but only if your process is rock solid. Stick with this playbook start to finish, and you\u2019ll have the structure to make it work. Leads won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re talking to a robot; they\u2019ll feel like they\u2019re talking to you. And then you'll be selling all day. Every day."

    "MAIN":"Timing and Pacing #\n\nTiming is everything in a conversation.\n\nIt's not just about when you reply---it's about syncing with their rhythm, respecting their silence, and knowing when to nudge.\n\nA perfectly timed message can build trust, keep the momentum alive, and lead the chat toward the outcomes you want.\n\nMatch Their Tempo #\n\nThe pace of their replies tells you how engaged they are. Quick replies signal interest---respond with equal energy. Slow replies? Take it easy and match their rhythm. Pushing too fast can kill the vibes.\n\nQuick Tempo Example: #\nThem:\u00a0\"That sounds interesting. How does it work?\"\nYou (fast):\u00a0\"Let me break it down quickly---[brief explanation]. What's the dream outcome you're hoping for from [the product\/solution]?\"\n\nWhy It Works: You respond with clarity and purpose while keeping the conversation moving. The question opens a door for them to share their priorities.\n\nSlower Tempo Example: #\nThem (earlier):\u00a0\"We're looking into solutions for [problem].\"\n[Silence for a day]\nYou:\u00a0\"Busy week? One of my clients had a similar challenge recently---it made me think of you. Want me to share what worked for them?\"\n\nWhy It Works: It respects their slower pace, giving them space while subtly keeping the conversation alive.\n\nSilence Doesn't Mean \"No\" #\n\nWhen they go quiet, don't assume you've lost them. Silence is often just life getting in the way. Your job is to re-engage with relevance---not desperation.\n\nExample: #\nYou:\u00a0\"Hey [Name], just circling back. I was thinking about our last chat and came across [specific resource]. Would it be helpful if I shared it?\"\n\nWhy It Works: Instead of repeating what you've already said, you bring fresh value to the table, keeping the conversation about their needs, not your pitch.\n\nFollow Up with Purpose #\n\nEvery follow-up should add something new to the conversation. A fresh angle, a timely observation, or a nudge tied to their world keeps your messages relevant and welcome.\n\nExample 1: Tied to Their Problem #\nYou:\u00a0\"Hi [Name], I remember you mentioned [specific challenge]. I just helped another client with a similar issue and thought of you. Want me to share what worked for them?\"\n\nWhy It Works: You're not just following up---you're creating value while keeping the focus on their unique challenge.\n\nExample 2: Light and Casual #\nYou:\u00a0\"Hey [Name], just saw [specific industry news\/event] and thought of you. It hits right on [their challenge or goal]. If it's still something you're working on, I've got an idea that might help---want me to share?\"\n\nWhy It Works: This casual check-in feels natural and conversational, not like a hard sell.\n\nKnow When to Let Go (Temporarily)\u00a0 #\n\nIf follow-ups don't land, don't force it. Sometimes they're just not ready. Leave the door open and come back when the timing is right.\n\nExample: #\nYou:\u00a0\"I know timing might not be perfect right now---totally get it. I'll check back in a few weeks. If anything changes before then, just let me know!\"\n\nWhy It Works: It shows empathy while leaving a positive impression. You're respecting their space without losing the connection entirely.\n\nThe Key to Timing: Precision and Patience #\n\nTiming and pacing aren't about spamming quick replies or sitting on your hands---it's about reading the room.\n\nMatch their energy, add fresh value when you follow up, and leave space when needed.\n\nMastering these nuances doesn't just improve your reply rates; it makes your messages feel natural, human, and worth replying to.\n\nEvery message is an opportunity to build trust, and trust leads to action.

Offer something valuable and easy to act on, paired with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nYou: \"I've got an idea that might make [their challenge] easier.

By sharing the right insights at the right time, you turn skepticism into curiosity and curiosity into action.\n\nBut let's be clear: preloaded value isn't about overwhelming people with everything you know. It's about being so specific, so targeted, that they feel like you've cracked the code on their exact problem."

Make It Ungated #\n\nDon't throw up barriers like sign-ups or downloads. Share your value openly. It feels generous, and generosity builds trust.\n\n3. Keep It Actionable #\n\nNobody remembers fluff. Give them something they can act on right away\u2014a checklist, a framework, or even a single insight that flips how they think.\n\n4.

Want me to share what we did?\"\n\nReignite Interest: If the conversation's gone quiet, bring in something fresh and relevant. Example:\n\n\"Hey [Name], I just worked with someone in a similar spot and thought of you. The results were wild\u2014want to hear how we made it work?\"\n\nMake It Easy: Keep the ask simple and low-effort. Example:\n\n\"Want me to send the details?\"\n\nThe Right Timing #\n\nTiming can make or break your follow-ups. A simple rhythm like this keeps you top of mind without overwhelming:\n\nDay 1: Follow up the day after your first message or call.\nDay 3: Check back in to keep momentum.\nDay 7: A thoughtful nudge shows you're still there.\n\nAfter this, space your follow-ups every couple of weeks to avoid burning the lead.\n\nDon't Overthink It #\n\nFollow-ups don't have to be complicated. Keep them human, casual, and focused on the prospect's needs. Even a simple, \"Hey [Name], just checking in\u2014did you get a chance to look at [resource]?\" goes a long way.\n\nWhy Follow-Ups Are Worth It #\n\nMost people stop too early, leaving potential deals to fizzle out.\n\nIf you stick with it\u2014while staying respectful\u2014you'll stand out.

Define Your Pipeline Stages #\n\nUse Kondo's labels to create and manage the key pipeline stages for Sell-by-Chat:\n\nNew Leads: Leads you plan to message for the first time.\nAwaiting Reply: Leads you've contacted but haven't responded yet.\nReplied: Leads who've replied but aren't yet qualified.\nQualifying: Leads actively engaged in conversations to determine fit.\nCall Booked: Leads who've agreed to a call but haven't attended yet.\nClosed: Leads who've completed a call and are either converted or not.\n2. Customise Your Labels and Inboxes #\nCreate Labels for Pipeline Stages: #\nUse the L key in Kondo to assign a label to a conversation.\nCreate these labels:\nNew Leads\nAwaiting Reply\nReplied\nQualifying\nCall Booked\nClosed\nOrganise Inboxes by Priority: #\nMove high-priority inboxes to the top of the list to ensure these conversations are processed first.\n3. Configure Daily Workflows with Kondo #\nOutreach: #\n\nAdd New Leads:\n\nUse LinkedIn Sales Navigator to source leads based on your ICP. Note: Kondo only works with 1st-degree connections.\nOnce a connection request is accepted, initiate first contact in LinkedIn and label the conversation as New Leads.\n\nTrack Progress:\n\nIf a lead doesn't respond after 48 hours, move the conversation to Awaiting Reply and schedule a follow-up with H (reminder).\nRespond and Engage: #\n\nManage Replies:\n\nNavigate to the Replied inbox and process conversations.\nUse Enter to open a message and reply quickly.\nFor leads showing interest, move them to the Qualifying inbox.\n\nTake Notes:\n\nUse the note-taking feature (;) to document conversation context:\nLast message direction (e.g., \"Awaiting their response\").\nNext steps (e.g., \"Follow up in 3 days\").\nImportant details (e.g., \"budget, timelines and key problems\")\nNotes stick to the conversation and reappear for future context.\nCall Booking: #\n\nMove to Call Booked:\n\nWhen a lead agrees to a call, label the conversation as Call Booked.\nInclude call details in the notes (e.g., \"Call scheduled for [date\/time]\").\n\nSend Reminders:\n\nUse reminders (H) to nudge leads before the scheduled call.\nClosing Deals: #\n\nTrack Outcomes:\n\nAfter the call, label the conversation as Closed and include deal details:\nClosed-Won: Include deal size (e.g., \"$3,000\").\nClosed-Lost: Note why the deal didn't convert.\n4.

Warm Signal Prioritisation #\n\nWhen warm signals appear (e.g., profile views, post engagement, or connection requests), prioritise them immediately:\n\nUse tailored scripts stored in Kondo's canned responses called 'Snippets':\n\nExample:\n\nProfile Views: \"Hi [Name], noticed you checked out my profile\u2014thanks for stopping by! Quick question\u2014was it [topic A] or [topic B] that caught your attention?\"\n6. Metrics and Tracking #\n\nKondo doesn't have built-in analytics, so you'll need to track key metrics manually in a simple spreadsheet. Luckily we built one for you here.\n\nPipeline Metrics: #\nNew Leads Added\nLeads in Each Stage\nConversion Metrics: #\nReplies (%)\nQualifying Conversations (%)\nCalls Booked (%)\nDeals Closed (%)\nRevenue Metrics: #\nWeekly Revenue\nCumulative Revenue\nKey Kondo Shortcuts for Sell-by-Chat #\nAction\tShortcut\tDescription\nArchive a message\tE\tRemoves clutter from your inbox.\nRemind later\tH\tSets a reminder to revisit a conversation.\nLabel a conversation\tL\tAssigns a pipeline stage (e.g., Qualifying, Call Booked).\nMute irrelevant messages\tM\tHides irrelevant conversations.\nWrite a reply\tEnter\tOpens a message and allows you to reply.\nAdd a note\t;\tDocuments last message direction and next steps, sticking with the conversation.\nWhy This Works #\nSpeed and Simplicity:\nKondo's shortcuts and custom labels streamline navigation and follow-ups.\nFull Pipeline Visibility:\nSeparate inboxes for each pipeline stage ensure no lead is overlooked, but remember that Kondo works with 1st-degree connections only. Be sure to check LinkedIn for pending connection requests and manage pre-connection outreach separately.\nContext Clarity:\nNotes and reminders provide the necessary context for all conversations.\n\nThis setup is a lightweight, simple system for managing Sell-by-Chat with LinkedIn and Kondo."
